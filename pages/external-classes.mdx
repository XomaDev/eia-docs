# Classes in Eia

Eia supports adding external class and lets you access its public functions and variables.
You may import an external class as a static or an instantiated object.

## Defining Classes

So how do you define a class?\
It's really simple, just add `visible` modifier to global variables and functions to make it visible to other classes.

```go filename="Meow.eia" copy
visible fn sayMeow() {
  println("Meow!")
}
```

By default, all the variables and functions are marked `private`.

### Constructors

In Eia, you may add an object constructor by defining a `visible` `init` with desired arguments.
You may define multiple of `init` functions with varying number of arguments.

> init() function is not required if you are accessing a class statically

```swift filename="Person.eia" copy
; Global visible variables that stores a person^s name and their age
; Variables initially nil (null)

visible var person: String = nil
visible var age: Int = nil

visible fn init(name: String) {
  person = name
  age = 20  ; default age
}

visible fn init(name: String, _age: Int) {
  person = name
  age = _age
}

visible fn printUser() {
  println(format("Person named %s of age %d", person, age))
}
```

## Including an external class

You can include an external class using `include` keyword.
E.g., including `Person`.eia which lies in the same directory (`simulation`).

```swift filename="Main.eia" copy
include(
  "simulation/Person"
   ...
)
```

### If a path

1. Starts with `/`, Eia assumes it's a full path.
2. Doesn't start with `/`, it appends user directory at the beginning.
3. Starts with prefix `stdlib`, it is replaced by path of standard library directory.

## Creating objects

`new` keyword is used to create an instance of a class:

```swift filename="Main.eia" copy
; Create an instance of Person using either init(name: String)
; or init(name: String, age: Int)

let person = new Person("Melon", 16)
person.printUser()
println(person.age)
```

It prints the following:

```
Person named Melon of age 16
16
```

## Static usage of a class

Consider this file:

```kotlin filename="Cat.eia" copy
include(static:std:string)

var lastNTimes = 0

visible fn sayMeow(nTimes: Int) {
  nTimes += lastNTimes
  println("Meow ".repeat(nTimes))
}
```

Now, to use this file statically, we'll import it:

```kotlin filename="Main.eia" copy
include(static:"simulation/Cat.eia")
```

then we use it:

```kotlin filename="Main.eia" copy
println(sayMeow(2))
println(sayMeow(3))
```

this outputs the following:

```
Meow Meow
Meow Meow Meow Meow Meow
```
