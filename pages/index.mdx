# Project Eia
 
Ever since I was 12â€“13, I've loved interpreters! (ATM I'm 16 y/o)\
One of my friends recommended the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
by Robert Nystrom which taught me basic foundational ideas and mechanics of an interpreter.
Even before I discovered this book,
I had spent a lot of days creating interpreters (which were not so good, but fun to make!)

## How does Eia work

![HowEiaWorks](../public/images/HowEiaWorks.png)

Eia is written in Kotlin, a JVM Language.
Kotlin compiles down into platform independent Bytecode that is later executed by the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM).
JVM is implemented in C++.

So when you write code in Eia, there are <b><i>three layers</i></b> of abstraction the code has to go through to get executed.\
This makes execution really slowww...\
A `fib(n)` function which takes couple hundred millis to execute on Eia, takes a
split second on Java, and not even few millis on C++.

This gives any form of compiled language an edge over purely interpreted ones like this one.

> Fun fact: Python isn't a purely interpreted nor a compiled language. It's a mix where code is turned into Bytecode by
the parsed syntax trees that is later executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

## Source of enthusiasm

This is not my first attempt towards making a language.
I've done many in the past.
So initially, I was skeptical towards working on the project, thought couldn't make it much better after all those efforts.
But honestly, I've learnt a lot in the process that was unimaginable just a couple of months ago.

Originally part of <b>`lang-jam`</b> hosted by HackClub!
Also part of my Arcade <b>\<3</b>, that gave me an immense boost of
productivity and long dedication required.
