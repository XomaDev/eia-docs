# Eia Std Lib

What? Eia has a std lib? Yes!! ðŸ˜²

In Eia, primitive data types have an associated std-lib, namely `string`, `eint`, `array`, `etype` (for `Type`).\
While you can still operate on primitive types, you won't be able to use standard methods unless you include the associated
standard library.
