# Syntax

Eia64 draws inspiration from the lovely syntax of Kotlin and many other languages like Go. ☘️\
It is a strongly typed language, with emphases on explicit data type programing, while also featuring fully automatic
type resolution system (which was a big milestone for me!)

A lot of cool example source files can be found at [Eia64/examples](https://github.com/XomaDev/Eia64/tree/main/examples).
