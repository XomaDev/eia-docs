Some fascinating/cool stuff. ðŸ’ª
(The best are ordered first)

To try out all the examples yourself, just clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/XomaDev/Eia64
cd Eia64
```

Eia requires a minimum version of Java 11 to run.

### Trash Guy Animation

```bash
java -jar Eia64.jar examples/animation.eia
```

He asks you for a text:

But don't be kind! If you give it to him, he will steal it! ðŸ˜­

### Math solver

What about a simple math interpreter written in an interpreted language Eia which is written in JVM language Kotlin which is powered by C++? ðŸ¥°

![Layers](../public/images/layers.png)

Eia64 is written in Kotlin, which is a JVM Language. JVM Languages don't convert source code directly into machine code,
they produce custom Bytecode instructions that are then executed by the Java Virtual Machine. JVM is implemented in C++.

Right now, the math interpreter can perform basic arithmetic operations (`+` `-` `/` `*`) with operators `*` and `/` having
higher priority.

```bash
java -jar Eia64.jar examples/mathsolver.eia
```

Note that the math interpreter doesn't utilize `Float` type, so doing floating point division or multiplication will round of the result.

### Fib function

```bash
java -jar Eia64.jar examples/superfib.eia
```

[View the source file.](https://github.com/XomaDev/Eia64/blob/main/examples/superfib.eia)\
It is a good way to benchmark things. ðŸ‘€

```kotlin copy
private fn fib(n: Int): Int =
    if (n < 2) n
    else fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

fn main() {
  let startTime = time()

  println(
      "Result: " + fib(30),
      format(" took %d ms", time() - startTime)
  )
}
```

```
Result: 832040 took 442 ms
Took 482787497 ns
```

Cold start takes around ~488 millis to compute the `fib()` function on my PC.
