# Basic syntax

Collection of basic code snippets to get a quick start!

> Note: a semicolon `;` is used to add comments

## Program entry point

Part of code from where the execution begins! In Eia, the entry point is the `main` function.

```kotlin {1} copy
fn main() {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

> This is optional! Just like Python, you can directly write down the codes without necessarily having a main function.
 But when this source file is imported, it may evaluate code located outside `main` that you may not require!

## Standard I/O operations

`println` and `print` prints its argument to the standard output.

```kotlin copy
print("Meow\n")
println("Thank you", " Hackclub!")
```

Similarly, `readln` function reads an entire line from the standard input.

```swift copy
; Requests the user to enter a name
println("Enter a name: ")

; Reads and stores the name
let name = readln()

; Hello $name
println("Hello ", name)
```

## Variables

Inspired by Swift! Declare a variable using either `let` or `var`.

Use the `let` keyword to create immutable constant that cannot be reassigned.\
To create a mutable variable with re-assignable property, use the `var` keyword.

```js copy
let name = "Hackclub!"
; 'name' is a constant that can only be accessed!
```

```swift copy
; Creates a variable 'count' with initial value of 7
var count = 7
; Increment the count by 2
count += 2
; 9
```

> Eia has an automated type resolution system, you don't need to explicitly specify data types, it is auto-detected.

## Primitive types

Primitive classes in Eia are `Bool`, `Int`, `Char`, `Float`, generic `Num`, `String`, `Array`/`Array<N>`,
`Type`, (that holds signatures), `Unit`, `Nil`, `Any`\
An example of few:

```swift copy
println(
  "Meow World",   ; a string
  'H',            ; a character
  true,           ; boolean type
  123,            ; an integer
  2.8,            ; a float
  nil,            ; null type

  { println("Meow") }            ; a Unit, anonymous lambda that can be invoked using `<unit>(args..)`
  arrayOf("meow", "world"),      ; implicit array declaration (type is auto resolved)
  arrayOf<Any>(2, "hello"),      ; an array containing mixed data types
  makeArray<Int>(5, 8)           ; create an array of integer of size 5 with default value 8
)
```

This outputs the following:

```
Meow World
H
true
123
2.8
EArray(meow, world)
EArray(2, hello)
EArray(8, 8, 8, 8, 8)
```

## Conditional Expressions

Eia lang's behaviour of If expressions is very identical to that of Kotlin.

```swift copy
let x = 5
let y = 8

if (x > y) {
  println("X is greater")
} else {
  println("Y is greater")
}
```

You may use `if` not just for flow control, but also as an expression:

```swift copy
let x = 5
let y = 8

println(if (x > y) "X is greater" else "Y is greater")
```

Branches of an if expression can be blocks. In this case, the last expression is the value of a block:

```swift copy
let a = 10
let b = 20

let max = if (a > b) {
    print("Choose a")
    a
} else {
    print("Choose b")
    b
}

println(max)
; Choose b
; 20
```

If you're using if as an expression, for example,
for returning its value or assigning it to a variable, the else branch is mandatory.

### For loop

```swift copy
let places = arrayOf("India", "Japan", "Germany")
for (place in places) {
  println(place)
}
```

or the classical way:

```swift copy
let places = arrayOf("India", "Japan", "Germany")
for (var i = 0, i < len(places), i++) {
  println(places[i])
}
```

### Until loop

```swift copy
let places = arrayOf("India", "Japan", "Germany")
var index = 0
until (index < len(places)) {
  println("Item at index " + index + " is " + places[index])
  index++
}
```

### Special loop

It's one of the special feature offered by Eia!

Iterating backwards from 5 to 1:

```swift copy
each (x: 5 to 1) {
  println(x)
}
```

Iteration from 2 to 10 by increment of 2:

```swift copy
each (y: 2 to 10 by 2) {
  println(x)
}
```

### Type checks and casting

Like Kotlin, the `is` checks if an expression belongs to a certain type.

```swift copy
let a = "Meow!"
println(a is String)            ; true
println("Meow" + 8 is Int)      ; false
println(arrayOf("Hack", "Club!") is Array<String>)      ; true
```

To cast values, for example from `Any` to `Int` or generic `Array` to `Array<Int>` we use the cast operator `::` followed
by a type:

```swift copy
; casting from Any to String
let name: Any = "Meow"
let reName: String = name::String

; casting from generic Array to Array<Int>
let gArray = arrayOf(7::Any, 8::Any)        ; gArray has signature Array<Any>
let eArray = gArray::Array<Int>             ; eArray has signature Array<Int>
```
