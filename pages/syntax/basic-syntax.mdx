# Basic syntax

Collection of basic code snippets to get a quick start!

## Program entry point

Part of code from where the execution begins! In Eia, the entry point is the `main` function.

```kotlin {1} copy
fn main() {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

> This is optional! Just like Python, you can directly write down the codes without necessarily having a main function.
 But when this source file is imported, it may evaluate code located outside `main` that you may not require!

## Standard I/O operations

`println` and `print` prints its argument to the standard output.

```kotlin copy
print("Meow\n")
println("Thank you", " Hackclub!")
```

Similarly, `readln` function reads an entire line from the standard input.

```kotlin copy
; Requests the user to enter a name
println("Enter a name: ")

; Reads and stores the name
let name = readln()

; Hello $name
println("Hello ", name)
```
