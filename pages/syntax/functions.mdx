# Functions

Eia functions are declared using the `fn` keyword:

```rust copy
fn square(x: Int): Int {
  return x * x
}
```

then to call a function:

```swift
let squared = square(5)
```

## Parameters

Parameters are defined in the format `name: Type` and are seperated using commas:

```rust copy
fn sayMeow(n: Int) {
  println("Meow ".repeat(n))
}
```

## Inline functions

A function defined without curly braces with an expression as a body:

```rust copy
fn square(x: Int): Int = x * x
```

## Nested functions

Also known as local functions in Kotlin, you can define a function inside another function:

```swift copy
fn construst(name: String, age: Int): String {
  var details = ""

  fn appendLine(value: String) {
    details += value
    details += '\n'
  }

  appendLine("A person called " + name)
  appendLine("Of age " + age)
  return details
}
```

## Function overloading

Eia supports function overloading, there can be many functions with the same name, but must have unique parameters size.

```swift copy
fn greet() {
  println("Good Morning!")
}

fn greet(name: String) {
  println(format("Good Morning %s!", name))
}
```

## Access modifiers

There are modifiers, a default `private` modifier and `visible` (public) modifier:

```kotlin copy
; Visible to only the current class
private fn calculate(xPos: Int, yPos: Int, zPos: Int) { .. }

; Visible to everyone that imports the class
fn calculate(x: Int, y: Int): Int { ... }
```
